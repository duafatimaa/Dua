## Hub And Swich
Hub:  

Hub is a networking device which is used to transmit the signal to each port (except one port) to respond from which the signal was received. Hub is operated on Physical layer. In this packet filtering is not available. It is of two types: Active Hub, Passive Hub.  

It is also known as a repeater as it transmits signal to every port except the port from where signal is received. Also, hubs are not that intelligent in communication and processing information for 2nd and 3rd layer. 

A hub is a networking device that is used to connect multiple devices together on a network. It is a physical layer device that transmits data from one port to all other ports, except the port from which the data was received. It is not intelligent and cannot filter packets. It is also known as a repeater. 
Types of Hub: 

It is of two types:  

Active Hub: 

Active Hub is a type of hub which is used to boost the signal strength. It is used to extend the network. It is used to connect different segments of the network. It is used to control the traffic of the network. 

Passive Hub:  

A passive Hub is a type of hub used to connect the different segments of the network. It does not boost signal strength. It is used to connect the devices in the same segment of the network. 

Switch:  

Switch is a network device which is used to enable the connection establishment and connection termination based on need. Switch is operated on Data link layer. In this packet filtering is available. It is type of full duplex transmission mode and it is also called efficient bridge. 

A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices together on a single network. It operates at the data link layer of the OSI model, and it is used to create a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN). Switches are used to manage traffic on the network and can be used to filter, forward, or block traffic. Switches can also be used to segment a network into multiple subnets, allowing for more efficient traffic management.
